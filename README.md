## 🌱 My AI Learning Journey  

My fascination with intelligent systems began in school, where I built a *solar-powered water-based air heater-cum-cooler* that was recognized in a national newspaper. This spark grew into a journey spanning **robotics, machine learning, GNSS, embedded AI, and healthcare applications**.  

### 🚀 Early Robotics & Innovation  
- Member of **Drishti**, Gujarat’s largest robotics student chapter.  
- **Agastya Rover** – Finalist at International Rover Design Challenge (2023) & International Rover Challenge (2024).  
- **SWEEP – Beach Cleaning Robot** – Winner at **Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2023**, implemented obstacle detection + trash path-planning.  
- Explored **ROS, ROS2, Gazebo, Rviz**, computer vision, and path planning (A*, LiDAR-based crater avoidance).  

### ❤️ AI for Social Good  
- **Smart Vision Glasses** for the visually impaired (Jetson Nano): obstacle detection, traffic light recognition, text-to-speech reading.  
- **LipNet**: Lipreading model for the hearing impaired, implemented with Spatio-Temporal CNN + Bi-GRU.  
- **Pink Bollworm Detection** for cotton farmers: AI-based crop monitoring with NPK sensors and pest detection.  
- **Smart Irrigation System** with GSM-based alerts for farmers.  

### 🔬 Research Internships & Academic Projects  
- **IIT Roorkee (2023)** – Bearing fault detection using accelerometer vibration data and feature selection (Fisher Score, Relief-F, Lasso). Achieved **98% accuracy**.  
- **Space Applications Centre, ISRO (2024)** –  
  - *Differential GNSS using EKF*: Achieved **1.29m accuracy** for ELFO orbit.  
  - *Satellite Constellation Fault Detection* using graph rigidity & inter-satellite links.  
  - *Lunar Crater Detection* with anisotropic Gaussian + convex grouping (**92% detection, 85% precision**).  
- **Final Year Project** – GNSS Spoofing Detection using Short-Time Fourier Transform + Truncated-SVD preprocessing with CNN-based classification.  

### 💻 Industry Experience  
- **E-Infochips, ARROW (2025)** –  
  - Designed a **full-duplex HTTP client-server framework** in C++ (Boost.Asio/Beast).  
  - Optimized **TCP-based multithreaded architecture**, achieving **83µs latency** and **12K+ requests/sec**.  

### 📊 Competitive & Applied Projects  
- **Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) on STM32L4** –  
  - Edge-optimized CNN achieving **84% accuracy**, deployed on microcontroller.  
  - Winner of **STMicroelectronics Innovation Fair** ($500 prize).  
- **Stable Diffusion – Image-to-Prompt (Kaggle)** – Ranked **643 worldwide** using ResNet50 + LSTM + attention mechanism.  
- **Mouseless Cursor** – Hands-free desktop control using 3D hand tracking and gesture classification.  
- **Attendance Recorder (Siamese Networks)** – One-shot learning with **94% accuracy**, deployed at SVNIT.
